# React Portfolio Website

## Project Description

Welcome to the React Portfolio Website project. This project aims to create a frontend portfolio website using React, showcasing various user functionalities such as a navigation menu, a user sign-in form, an API-loaded image list, and an interactive search field.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will learn how to:

- Create a Navigation Menu.
- Develop a User Sign In form displaying different content based on user interactions.
- Load images from an API and display them with accompanying title, author, and description text.
- Implement an Interactive Search Field.

## Getting Started

### In the terminal do:

<code>cd my-app</code>

<code>nvm install 16 && nvm use 16</code>

<code>npm install</code>

### You can then run the project with the command

<code>npm start</code>

### Items to be aware of

Inside the folder named `src` you will find a file named `posts.json`. This file will not be used until a challenge later in the content.

For convenience, React comes installed in this template. A package named `axios` has also been installed as it will be required in a challenge later.

## Features

### Navigation Menu

A responsive navigation menu to navigate through different sections of the portfolio.

### User Sign In Form

A user sign-in form that displays different content based on user interactions.

### API-Loaded Image List

An image list loaded from an API, complete with title, author, and description text.

### Interactive Search Field

A search field that allows users to filter the displayed images based on their search query.
